- Create report outlines:
	- Objective section. Text about the project's objective
	- Add Chapters:
		- Introduction (what is the software, what do we want to implement and how is this achieved)
		- Generate data (optimized volumes)
			- Variables (what are they)
			- Scope (lock some variables)
			- What "customer groups" can be looked at. 
			- Statistically find out what is most interesting to look at
		- Analysis and visualization of generated data
		- Analysis (and visualization) of collected data (from database)
		- Per
	- Add figures to chapters
- calc2.js: calc.js must break faster. I.e. an optimized calc.js that continues/breaks when (for each length) it has found
volumes
- Load and interpret collected data from the database.
- Test some Regression models:
	- Linear (baseline) (!)
	- Ridge 
	- Neural Network (!)
	- Lasso
	- Decision Tree (!)
	- Random Forest (!)
	- KNN
	- SVM
